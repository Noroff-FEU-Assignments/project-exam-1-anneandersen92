        <p>I am given eight weeks to complete the semester project. Because of this, the timeline on the Gantt chart is numbered from Week 1 to Week 8, rather than calendar week numbers (40 to 47). I think this will make it more practical to use because I can get a quick overview on how many weeks I have spent and how many are left. If I at any point am behind schedule, I can adjust the not completed tasks timeline according to the remaining weeks and days.</p>
        <p class="fw-medium">The critical timeline and the floating tasks are all given x number of days and x amount of hours each day according to previous modules and deliveries, my work schedule and plans over the next eight weeks. This is of course just an estimate. I am sure there will be days that consist of more or less hours, and some none at all.rhoncus vitae ipsum vel, semper euismod lectus.
