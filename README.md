# OH Sheet | Project Exam 1

![image](resources/images/ohsheet.png)

## Description

OH Sheet is an interactive and dynamic blog developed by me for my Project Exam 1 assignment, which is part of the Front-end Development program at Noroff. By using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and headless WordPress I have created a functional and responsive blog with a tidy and modern design. The site features, among other things:

- a home page with a 'most read' section displaying posts in a carousel
- a blog page that shows by default the 10 latest posts, with the option to view more
- a blog specific page consisting of content dynamically built using query string parameters
- an image modal which gives the user an option to get a bigger view of the blog images
- a contact page with form validation which displays an error message if requirements are not met
- content that is managed with WordPress, and is fetched using WordPress REST API (CMS is headless)
- a design responsive across different sized devices which also appeals to the target audience
